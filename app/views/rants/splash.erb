    <div><p class="white-text">"Rantly has allowed a certain freedom I never thought possible. Now I can rant to the
      internet
      at large, without having to worry about my thoughts. I just type it out, hit click, and feel the surge of relief!
      Thanks Rantly, you've truly made my most insane rants heard. I remember a time when I wasn't able to truly
      express myself It's really frustrating when you want to be heard and no one..."<br><br> | Jeff Taggart, avid Ranter
